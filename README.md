# SmartTriage AI

SmartTriage AI is an AI-powered healthcare triage system designed to help remote and under-resourced clinics prioritize patients efficiently and save lives.

## 🚑 Problem
Remote clinics often struggle with limited medical staff, long queues and manual triage processes. This leads to delayed treatment for critical patients and avoidable health risks.

## 💡 Solution
SmartTriage AI uses artificial intelligence to analyze patient symptoms, vital signs and medical history, then automatically assigns a triage level:
- 🔴 Red – Critical
- 🟡 Yellow – Urgent
- 🟢 Green – Routine

Healthcare workers receive clear, explainable AI recommendations through a real-time dashboard.

## 🧠 How AI is Used
- Natural Language Processing to understand free-text symptoms
- Severity scoring (0–100) using Gemini AI
- AI-generated explanations to support medical staff decisions  
⚠️ SmartTriage AI assists healthcare workers — it does not replace them.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: PHP
- Database: MySQL
- AI Engine: Google Gemini AI

## ⚙️ System Workflow
1. Patient data is entered via a web form
2. Backend sends structured data to Gemini AI
3. AI returns triage level, severity score and recommendations
4. Results are stored in MySQL
5. Dashboard updates in real time
